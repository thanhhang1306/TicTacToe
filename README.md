# TicTacToe (a recreation by Hang Pham)
The following project provides a recreation of the popular game Tic Tac Toe, with some novel functionalities. This was one of Hang's many Java projects during her studies in high school, where she redeveloped games that played a huge role in her childhood. Note that this game has only been tested on Windows OS, not Mac OS. Therefore, playing on Mac OS might lead to incompatible fonts and other issues.

## Guide to Game 
Enjoy the game of Tic Tac Toe on a 6x6 board, where the player selects how many points-in-a-row is required to win. More flexibility, more fun! More instructions are available within the game.

## Installation
Use a Java Integrated Development Environment, such as Eclipse, to run the code. Every file but the README.md file and files in the bin folder are required for the game to function. 


## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome but please credit Hang Pham. As this project was developed with a relatively intermediate knowledge of programming (based on knowledge taught in school), the code might not be the most optimal. Additionally, note that the game has only been tested on Windows OS, not MAC OS. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.
